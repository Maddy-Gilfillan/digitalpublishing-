Make <br>small signs that say “yes” and spread them<br>all over your house. Become a friend of freedom<br>and uncertainty. Look forward to dreaming. Cry at the<br> movies. Swing as high as you can on a swing at moonlight.<br>Maintain different moods. Refuse to be “responsible”. Do it out of <br>love. Take a lot of naps. Pass on money. Do it now. The money will follow. <br>Laugh a lot. Bathe in the moonlight. Dream wild, imaginative dreams. Draw on <br>the walls. Read every day. Imagine you are enchanted. Giggle with children. Listen to<br> old people. Open yourself. Dive in. Be free. Praise Yourself. Let go of fear. Play with everything.<br> Preserve the child in you. You are innocent. Build a castle of covers. Get wet. Hug trees. Write love letters.<br>
