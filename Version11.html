    Let yourself fall. Learn to observe snails. Plant <em id="orange">impossible</em> gardens. Let someone dangerous in for tea. Make small signs that say “yes” and spread them all over your house. Become a friend of <em id="blue">freedom</em> and uncertainty.
    Look forward to <em id="red"> dreaming </em>. Cry at the movies. Swing as high as you can on a swing at <em id="pink"> moonlight </em>. Maintain different moods. Refuse to be “responsible”. Do it out of love. Take a lot of naps. Pass on money. Do it now.
    The money will follow. Laugh a lot. Bathe in the moonlight. 
    <em id="purple">Dream</em> wild, imaginative dreams. Draw on the walls. Read every day. <em id="pink"> Imagine</em> you are enchanted. Giggle with children. Listen to old people. <em id="green"> Open </em>yourself. Dive in. Be <em id="orange">free</em>. Praise Yourself. Let go of fear. Play with everything. Preserve the child in you. You are <em id="blue">innocent</em>. Build a castle of covers. Get wet. Hug trees. <em id="red">Write love letters.</em>
